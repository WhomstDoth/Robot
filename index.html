      <h1>A Heading</h1>
      <p>
        This is a paragraph. Content that we place within
        a paragraphelement has a different default appearance,
        or "style", than the content we place within a heading
        element, which displays it's text content with a larger
        default "font-size".
      </p>
      <p>
        Every element has it's own default style, for example
        the <a href="https://netart.rocks">anchor element</a>
        will add an "underline" to any of it's content as well
        as change its color. This is done to let the user know
        that this text is a "link" which can be clicked to
        navigate to a different HTML page. Here is another
        <a href="https://netizen.org" target="_blank">link</a>
